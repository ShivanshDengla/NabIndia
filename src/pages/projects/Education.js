      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>
        Since its inception in the 1980s, the National Association for the Blind (NAB) India has been a
        pioneering force in the education and empowerment of visually impaired children. The organization
        began its journey in Mumbai with the introduction of Integrated Education, enabling children with
        visual impairments to study alongside their sighted peers. This evolved into a broader, more
        comprehensive Inclusive Education approach that ensures equal access to quality education for all
        children with disabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        To date, NAB India has reached over 78,000 visually impaired children, providing them academic
        empowerment and equipping many for careers in government and other sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this initiative, each educator caters to 12 children across different schools, from early
        childhood to secondary education. The educators teach curriculum and life skills including Braille,
        Taylor's frame, Abacus, mobility &amp; orientation training, and soft skills. They also play a vital role in
        sensitizing communities, parents, teachers, and schools.

      <h4>Collaborations and Government Support</h4>
      <p>
        NAB India has strengthened the Inclusive Education Programme through strategic collaborations and
        government partnerships. Key among these are MoUs with Composite Regional Centres (CRCs)
        under the Ministry of Social Justice &amp; Empowerment, Government of India. These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>CRC Chhatarpur, Madhya Pradesh</li>
        <li>CRC Jaipur, Rajasthan</li>
        <li>CRC Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These partnerships have enhanced service delivery, enabled better capacity building, and facilitated
        access to government schemes for children with visual impairments.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Collaborations:</h4>
      <p>
        Education Programme at NAB India is strengthened by strategic institutional partnerships,
        particularly with government-run Special school specially in UP. A notable collaboration is with Govt.
        Blind Inter Colleges operated by the State Government of Uttar Pradesh, located in Lucknow and
        Gorakhpur.
      </p>

      <h4>Digital Empowerment Initiatives</h4>
      <p>
        To ensure that visually impaired children are not left behind in the digital age, NAB India has
        introduced several initiatives under its Digital Empowerment component, currently covering over
        450 visually impaired students with the Govt. Blind School run by UP State Govt. partner
        institutions:
      </p>
      <h5>Computer Literacy Program</h5>
      <p>
        A structured computer education curriculum has been implemented, ranging from basic digital
        literacy (keyboard handling, use of screen readers like NVDA and JAWS) to advanced computer
        operations including MS Office, email communication, internet usage, and accessibility tools. This
        program empowers students to become digitally independent and prepares them for higher
        education and future employment.

      </div>

      <h5>Distribution of Assistive Devices</h5>
      <p>
        As part of our commitment to inclusive learning, Smart Vision Glasses wearable assistive
        devices—have been distributed to selected students. These glasses help the user read printed
        material, recognize faces, and identify objects in real-time, thereby significantly enhancing
        independence and confidence among the visually impaired. Alexa devices have also been distributed
        under the Alexa Community Program to more than 200 inclusive and special schools across 8 states.
      </p>
      <h5>Braille Transcription of Sacred Texts</h5>
      <p>
        Recognizing the importance of spiritual and cultural inclusion, NAB India has transcribed and
        distributed sacred texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayan in Braille format. These
        resources are made available free of cost to visually impaired students, enabling them to engage
        meaningfully with India’s rich cultural heritage in an accessible manner.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Programme Activities</h4>
      <p>
        The Inclusive Education Programme of NAB India was implemented across eight
        states—Maharashtra (Mumbai, Solapur, Nashik), Uttar Pradesh (Lucknow, Basti, Varanasi, Agra),
        Madhya Pradesh (Bhopal), Bihar (Jehanabad), Odisha (Nayagarh), Jammu &amp; Kashmir (Kashmir),
        Haryana (Faridabad), and Punjab (Chandigarh). During the 2024-25, a total of 704 children (417 boys
        and 287 girls), including 48 children with Multiple Disabilities with Visual Impairment (MDVI), were
        provided with academic, emotional, and accessibility support. This support was delivered by a
        dedicated team of 54 special educators to ensure the children's effective integration into
        mainstream education.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure holistic learning for children with visual impairment, the programme integrates ICT-based
        educational support using digital platforms and digital libraries. Special educators are regularly
        trained to improve instructional quality.
