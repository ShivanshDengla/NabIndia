      <p>
        Conscious about significance of the two most vital aspects of education for the blind – reading and writing – NAB (India) made a humble beginning in 1958 by starting a Braille Press in a small garage at Jogeshwari, Mumbai with machinery received in donation from the American Foundation for Overseas Blind. To begin with, the Braille Press brought out few general books, magazines and school textbooks. “Bapuji ki Jhankian” – a life sketch of Mahatma Gandhi – was the first book published by the Press.

      <p>
        In 1963, the Government of India designated the Braille Press as the Regional Braille Press for the Western Region. Soon enough, besides textbooks, periodicals and general books, the Braille Press took up printing of dictionaries, biographies/autobiographies of historical figures and religious classics like Ramayan, and Bhagwad Gita. During these years, M/s. Kanti and Shanti Shah made immense contribution to Braille production at the Press. In 1983, the Press was relocated at NAB (India) headquarters at Worli Seaface, Mumbai and was renamed NAB Sir Jamshedji Duggan Braille Press, in 1986.

        Sometime in mid-sixties, the Braille Press started its Tactile Graphics Unit with the help of a thermoform duplicator received in gift from the Vocational Rehabilitation Administration, U.S. Govt. Some unique creations of this Unit include: the Braille Atlas, illustrated books on acupressure and human reproduction and a booklet titled “Chitra Manjusha” containing embossed images of flowers, animals, birds, etc., to facilitate concept development in blind learners.

        In 1984, the Press was relocated at NAB (India) headquarters at Worli Seaface, Mumbai and was renamed NAB Sir Jamshedji Duggan Braille Press in 1986.

        In January 1990 the Shobhi El- Ejel Memorial Braille Library started functioning under the aegis of the Braille Press. Currently, a number of members make use of this library having a collection of over 1,500 books/periodicals.

        In 1994, a Computerized Braille Production Unit was initiated by installing a Norwegian computerized Braille embosser acquired with a munificent donation received from the Diwaliben Mohanlal Mehta Charitable Trust, Mumbai and the Indian community in Japan. This unit is known as—NAB Jitendra Mafatlal Mehta Computerized Braille Production Centre. From 2016 onwards the NAB Braille Press switched on towards making the Braille Embossing work totally on electronic production of Braille books and the old devices such as Platen machines were stopped as they need lot of manpower and maintenance also. We have installed high Speed Braille Embosser – Braillo 650 SW in December 2016 with the support received from Central Government of India under its Central Sector Scheme “Support for Establishment/Modernization/Capacity Augmentation of Braille Presses”  and soon after in April 2017, we have procured one more Braillo 650 SW with the generous donation from Ingram Micro India Pvt. Ltd and Rotary Club of Bombay Powai, that was the start of new era of electronic braille embossing in National Association for the Blind, India.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have yet again procured one high Speed Braille Embosser – Braillo 650 SW2 in September 2021 with the support received from Central Government of India under its Central Sector Scheme “Support for Establishment/Modernization/Capacity Augmentation of Braille Presses”.

      <p>The Refreshable Displays are being regularly used by our proof readers for copy holding and self-correction of soft copies of Braille books produced at the Braille Press. Braille Paper Print-outs are no longer used in the aforesaid process.</p>
      <p>Earlier, after the first round of proof reading (copy holding), the proof readers used to self-read a fresh copy of the book, mark the mistakes with the pencil and then sit with the data entry operators to revisit the markings and correct the mistakes. With the advent of Refreshable Braille Displays, self-reading and correction can be done simultaneously by the Visually Impaired proof readers without the assistance of the data entry operator, which saves the labour cost for the Braille Press along with paper.</p>
      <p>The Braille Press prints textbooks of all subjects – including Math and Science – for English and Marathi medium students of Class I to XII in Maharashtra.
