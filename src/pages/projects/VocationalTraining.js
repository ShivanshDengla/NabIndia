      <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
      <p>
        The National Association for the Blind (NAB) is a voluntary organization working for the welfare of the visually impaired since 1952. In 1985, with the financial assistance from the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the NAB has established a Polytechnic for the Visually Impaired at Ambarnath. This Polytechnic was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India, Late Shri Rajiv Gandhi. The Polytechnic with a capacity of 100 trainees aims to train the visually impaired youths on sophisticated machinery based on specially drafted technical trades. So far, it has trained a sizeable number of candidates from all over India. Some of them have been successfully employed in factories and workshops.

      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        A person who loses the most precious gift of God (sight) tends to become frustrated. He needs proper counseling, guidance, and training to boost up his confidence. Keeping this view in mind, the NAB has taken up this challenging training programme through which it would be possible to rehabilitate this unprivileged section of society socio-economically.
      </p>
      <h4>Objective</h4>
      <p>
        The Centre proposes to provide one year apprenticeship to the visually impaired trainees who pass out from the Polytechnic on completion of a one-year course as "Workshop Machine Operator." This will train them to become skilled workers and to be adapted to a regular workshop environment. Visually impaired persons are also trained to operate plastic molding machines, assemble various types of mechanical and electrical equipment, and make office files.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Centre also provides vocational training for developing 20 visually impaired persons per year in the Entrepreneurship Development Programme. It also collects bulk orders for training purposes from leading industries. The Centre provides work experience to the visually impaired under factory conditions. This prepares the visually impaired for independent self-employment or to start their own business or co-operative enterprises.
      </p>
      <h4>Benefits</h4>
      <p>
        The project benefits approximately 50 visually impaired annually. The trained entrepreneurs will be able to run a concern efficiently on commercial and business lines with modern management techniques, even if they do not succeed in getting appropriate jobs. The two-year training which the NAB-IDBI Polytechnic imparts is more or less on the line of Government ITIs. But the trained students are not absorbed by big industrial works as apprentices like their sighted counterparts. The Centre will thus meet this pressing need.

      <h4>Where do you come into picture?</h4>
      <p>
        The total recurring expenditure to run the project is worked out to Rs. 90 lakhs a year. As against this, the income from work orders is estimated at approximately Rs. 15 lakhs per year. The project is likely to be financially self-supporting once it gathers momentum. Meanwhile, the Project needs help from philanthropists like you.
