      <p>Economic independence – the fundamental requirement of any individual – when fulfilled leads to higher levels of self-esteem and self-worth; and this is applicable to one and all, including the visually impaired. NAB (India) realized this fact and started the first of its kind in the country employment and placement service for the visually impaired – the NAB Department of Employment – almost immediately after its establishment in 1952. It was only after NAB (India) initiated this vital service did the Government of India set up special employment exchanges in various states.</p>
      <p>Initially, NAB (India) employed several visually impaired persons in skilled and unskilled blue-collared jobs in the industry – mainly in factories, and textile and sugar mills. This continued for a fairly long time. The educated visually impaired were employed as telephone operators and other such jobs. Later, to enhance their employment prospects, NAB (India) started the Vending Stand Program and the Bureau of Self-employment.</p>
      <p>NAB Department of Employment was conferred National Award as ‘Best Placement Agency’ on 3rd December 2018.</p>

      <p>The Department plays a vital role in helping visually impaired job-seekers find suitable employment, by working closely with the candidates and liaising with companies – both in public and private sector – to give the visually impaired the opportunity to get into the work force.</p>
      <p>The employment options are categorized in terms of Open Employment, Self-Employment and Sheltered Employment.</p>

      <h4>Open Employment</h4>
      <p>Through Open Employment visually impaired persons are placed in the Government, public and private sector. Determined efforts are made to optimally utilize the 4% reservation for the disabled provided under the RPWD Act, 2016 secure jobs for the visually impaired in the Government and public sector; and convince prospective employers in the private sector to employ the visually impaired. The Department has immensely contributed to the process of identifying jobs in the open market, which could be managed by the visually impaired.</p>
      <p>As per the Government requirements the candidates have to fill and submit the online application forms for appearing CET Examinations. The department provides technical assistance for filling up such forms for the visually impaired candidates.</p>

      <h4>Online Competitive Examinations Training (CET) Course:</h4>
      <p>The Department of Employment regularly conducts Online Competitive Examinations (CET) Training Classes for visually impaired candidates, which helps them to appear for Public Sector Examinations and also provides orientation training at their job places as well as sensitization programmes for the employers.</p>

      <h4>Self-Employment:</h4>
      <p>In the early 80s, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) would allot sites to various NGOs in the disability sector, to put up telephone booths, which the NGOs allocated to disabled persons, to help them earn a livelihood. The sites given to NAB (India) were assigned to visually impaired persons for setting up PCOs or a vending stalls, sponsored by donors. Since past few years, MCGM has stopped providing new sites. Consequently, the Department these days gives deserving visually impaired persons only the old sites that are surrendered by visually impaired persons who have changed their occupation or expired.</p>
      <p>The department is providing financial assistance in a moderate way to initiate a small business to a visually impaired candidate.</p>
      <p>Unemployed visually impaired persons interested in self-employment are referred to funding agencies like the Maharashtra State Handicapped Finance Development Corporation, for financial assistance by way of loans, to start their own small business.</p>

      <h4>Sheltered Employment</h4>
      <p>Candidates who cannot be assisted under the two above stated categories are trained to make articles like paper bags, candles etc., at the Department’s Tejas Training Centre at NAB Rustom Alpaiwalla Complex at Cotton Green, Mumbai. They are paid Rs.125 per day as stipend. </p>
      <p>During Diwali, Christmas and many other occasions, Department participates in the exhibitions at various corporate offices and display items made by the visually impaired trainees of the department.</p>

      <h4>Training and Counseling</h4>
      <p>With conventional sources of employment drying out, the Department has initiated many new training programs such as: training in making novel items, marketing consumer products, Call Centre Operation, Medical Transcription etc. Many of our trained candidates work in Call Centres and have also been employed as Medical Transcriptionists by some reputed names in the field.</p>
      <p>The Department has partnered with some agencies that help prepare the candidates to face interviews and entrance tests for various competitive exams, thus helping them compete for jobs on an equal footing with sighted applicants. With a view to enhance their employability, job aspirants are provided communication and computer skills training. Visually impaired individuals are also offered pre and post-employment training which helps them to take up any CET Examinations.</p>

      <h4>NAB DVK Music Academy</h4>
      <p>The National Association for the Visually impaired, India started Music Academy for the Visually Impaired Persons at NAB Reay Road Complex, Cotton Green, Mumbai.  Internationally acclaimed Flute player Pt. Ronu Mujumdar inaugurated the NAB DVK Music Academy on19th November 2019.
