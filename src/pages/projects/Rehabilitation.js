  const history = (
    <p>
      An individual finds himself disoriented and feels helpless when he suddenly loses his sight at a later age. At other times, an individual may have been blind since birth but never had exposure to any kind of service that would lead to his rehabilitation. To bridge this gap, NAB (India) started the Department of Rehabilitation (DOR) in 1st April 1978.

      <h4>Training Courses</h4>
      <p>
        To begin with, DOR conducted Basic Rehabilitation Course for the visually challenged covering life skills and mobility and also initiated courses for employment officers and orientation &amp; mobility instructors, which in due course were withdrawn. Soon after however, appreciating the wide range of training requirements of its clients DOR initiated a number of need-based courses as well as vocational training courses in physiotherapy and acupressure &amp; massage.
      </p>

      <h4>Basic Rehabilitation Course</h4>
      <p>
        The course makes a blind person realize the Three A’s – Accept blindness, Adjust to blindness and Achieve despite being blind. This cost-free training course is conducted twice a year. Each batch is of 3½-month duration. The 30 trainees admitted per batch are given intensive training to develop skills in Activities of Daily Living which covers: Self-care (brushing, bathing, grooming, eating, etc.); Orientation &amp; Mobility (safe indoor and outdoor travel techniques using the White Cane); Home Management (sweeping, making bed, simple mending, cooking, ironing, sewing, identifying currency and so on); Communication (Braille reading and writing; social etiquette etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confidence-building to lead a normal and productive life takes place through activities like physical training, participation in sporting and cultural activities, visits to public spaces, familiarization with public transport etc. Trainees are also provided vocational guidance, exposure to work avenues open to them and assistance in identifying occupation that suits them most. They are given a small monthly stipend.
      </p>
      <p>
        DOR has the capacity to provide lodge and board facility to around 30 trainees.

        Each year the Department organizes demonstrations at various busy traffic junctions in Mumbai, to spread awareness about the White Cane as a symbol of independence of the blind and educate the public about the sighted guide techniques utilized to lead visually challenged individuals – while crossing the streets or commuting from one place to another.
